# FloMoMa2018
Art project for Florence Moore Hall's FloMoMa.

Given a list of residents, puts up a little slowly evolving timepiece that draws lines around people's names.

Takes in a list of names and draws lines making that name. Each line has a sound based off of the name given.

Sounds were provided by the Mini Metro RMX Kit ([here](https://music.disasterpeace.com/album/mini-metro-rmx-kit)).
